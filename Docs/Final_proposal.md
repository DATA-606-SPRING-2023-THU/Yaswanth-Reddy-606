# Classification of Bio Degradable and Non bio degrdadable materials.

## Data sets:

The data set contains thousands of images of Bio degradable and non bio degradable material pictures. It has two columns, one is the path of images for aterials and second column is the categorical value for respective material type indicated by 0 or 1.

Data set size: 1~2 GB.

Number of columns : 2

## 1. What is your issue of interest?

Solid waste management is one of the world's most severe problems. Solid waste is produced by a variety of human activities including residences, businesses, farms, and other industries, and poses serious dangers to the environment and the general public's health. When ignored, it may lead to a threat to the ecosystem. Segregation is one method of managing solid waste. Different sorts of solid trash are sorted to accomplish this. Therefore, to appropriately dispose of the garbage, it is crucial to explicitly identify its type. The problem is 'how do we manage this waste, while we can't use it anymore?'. Several nations have issues related to waste because the waste production rate is not at par with its management efforts. Many people just dispose of mixed waste in dump sites because they are unaware of the effects of garbage that has not been properly segregated before it is disposed of. Kitchen garbage, agricultural waste, and human and animal waste are all examples of biodegradable waste that can be broken down biologically by live microbes. Non-biodegradable wastes, on the other hand, are wastes that cannot be broken down biologically. Plastic, metal, glass, etc. are all included. This is the reason why managing non-biodegradable trash through various technologies and solutions has gained more significance in the modern day. To categorize waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable types, this work offers a solution for the stated problem using machine learning models, tensor flow, and convolutional neural networks.

## 2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?

The soild management classification has a huge environment impact on the entire population of earth. We can save and recycle thousands of tons of trash per year if we classify the trash in a proper way. 

## 3.What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?

- What kind of models can be used?
- What types of optimization works better in model?
- How can I handle data with more dimensionality?

## 4.Datasets

We are in the process of collecting the images. We target to collect more than 250K images from different sources in web.

Dataset size: ~2GB.

## 5.What is the end result of the project?

To successfully classify the solid waste to degradable and non degradable items.

## 6.What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis?

Planning to use images of these two categories and classify them.

## 7.How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?

- I plan to use Neural networks to train the mdoel for classification. 
My plan of action is to analyze the data first, research various types of ML models and come up with the best suited ones and implement a solution for the selected problem.

## 8.What outcomes do you intend to achieve?

- I intend to observe how different ML models can perform and to choose the best out of it based on the efficiency.
